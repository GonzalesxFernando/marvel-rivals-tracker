# Marvel Rivals Tracker

This is a small Python app I made to track wins, losses, and notes for characters in Marvel Rivals. I wanted something simple where I could keep track of which characters I’m doing well with and make quick notes about matches — kind of like a personal stat journal.

## What It Does

- Lets you choose a character from a dropdown
- You can log a win or a loss with a single click
- Add a short note about the match (optional)
- View all your stats in a popup — win/loss record, win rate, and any notes you added

## How to Use It

1. Make sure you have Python installed (version 3.x)
2. Download or clone this repo
3. Run the app with this command:
   ```bash
   python marvel_rivals_tracker.py
